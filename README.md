## Pointlist
###By [@anat](https://twitter.com/anat_gilboa) and Ben Edgar

###Approach
There are a number of cryptocurrency marketplaces that already exist, like [BitDazzle](https://bitdazzle.com),
 [Flibbr](http://www.flibbr.com), [Cryptothrift](https://cryptothrift.com), and [BitPremier](https://www.bitpremier.com).
 While the adoption of PointCoin still needs to grow, we hope this platform will help promote use of the
 cryptocurrency by providing a PointCoin-specific network with which buyers and sellers can meet each other and trade Coin.
